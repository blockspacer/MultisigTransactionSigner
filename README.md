XEMSign is a windows deployed bot which signs multisignature transactions based on a predefined rule set which is easily configured via the app.config file. All transactions are signed locally and the host machine is never communicated with directly making it a highly secure signing mechanism. 

It supports multiple private keys and will monitor any multisignature accounts those keys are cosignatory on.
